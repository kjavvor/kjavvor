# üí´ **Hello, World!** 
## Welcome to my profile!

üöÄ **I'm currently working on:**<br>

**Generating and identifying deepfake alterations in video content**<br>
- In my master's degree project, I am tackling the challenges and opportunities presented by `deepfake technology`. The core of my research involves developing sophisticated methods to both create and detect deepfake videos, aiming to preserve the authenticity of digital media. I am leveraging 'TensorFlow' and 'PyTorch' as the primary machine learning frameworks, and 'OpenCV' for handling video data. A key focus is on utilizing `Generative Adversarial Networks` (GANs) to realistically generate and effectively identify video forgeries. Additionally, `Transformer` models are explored for their potential to enhance the generation and detection processes due to their advanced pattern recognition capabilities. The effectiveness of these techniques is rigorously tested using comprehensive datasets such as FaceForensics++.

**Enhancing Continual Learning Through Classifier Calibration with Regularization**<br>
 - This project centers on testing how different classifier calibration methods can enhance continual learning models, specifically through the `Learning without Forgetting` (LwF) technique. The essence of classifier calibration is to ensure that a model's predicted probabilities match the actual chances of events happening‚Äîthis becomes crucial for maintaining reliability in predictions. Building on recent insights that show calibration can greatly improve knowledge distillation, we aim to apply these findings to see if they can also boost the performance of continual learning systems. We plan to use the [FACIL GitHub repository](https://github.com/mmasana/FACIL) as our starting point for experimentation with the LwF method, leveraging both new and established approaches to see how well they translate into improved learning outcomes.

**Diffusion model aimed at generating mathematical functions**<br>
- This project explores the innovative use of `diffusion models` to generate diverse mathematical functions, expanding the potential of `generative AI` in mathematical research. By adapting diffusion techniques, traditionally used for image generation, we aim to create models that iteratively refine randomness into structured `mathematical expressions`. The focus is on developing models that can propose novel functions, potentially offering new solutions or insights into complex mathematical problems. These functions are analyzed for their validity and utility, integrating advanced machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch, alongside mathematical tools such as MATLAB or SciPy for rigorous evaluation.
